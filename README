* About

Subversion (svn) aims to take over the CVS user base, while svk
attempts to take over the others - including people who already
switched to other scm, and people who had not started using scm. It is
written in Perl and is using subversion's underlying filesystem.

For more information plase see the web site at http://svk.elixus.org/

* Installation

to use svk.

svk uses the stanard perl module install process:

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
# make install

* Usage
