[Changes for 2.0.0 - 24 Dec, 2006]

  Dependency
    * Require Subversion 1.3.0
    * Require App::CLI, UNIVERSAL::require, YAML::Syck, Path::Class,
      Class::Accessor::Fast, Class::Data::Inheritable
    * No longer require YAML, Clone, Regexp::Shellish, Date::Parse

  Performance:
    * Don't load Locale::* modules if the user's language is English
    * Reduce Data::Hierarchy calls in checkout_delta
    * SVK::Mirror now uses a separate process to pipeline sync
    * Use POSIX::strftime for date formatting rather than Date::Parse
      The log command now runs about 25% faster when generating long
      logs

  Merge subsystem
    * Renames and copies can now be merged across branches
    * svk now tries to use alleged merge result as next merge base,
      making push more reliable and accurate
    * Interactive tree conflict resolution
    * Display the anchor along with THEIR and YOUR during interactive
      conflict resolution
    * Use svn:date to find the closest ancestor, not the revision number
    * use only related node as base if it is one of merge source or
      destination
    * When picking base, the immediate merged-from source should take
      precedence
    * When doing add-merge on checkout, unschedule the add
    * Only consider a g-merge to be a change when the merge source and
      destination paths are the same
    * Fix a leak in SVK::Editor::Merge in delete_entry
    * Fix merging a file change or deletion which has been replaced as
      directory

    * Add the negative number revision support
    * Make -r HEAD and -r BASE case insensitive
